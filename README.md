# User Expierence 
- When being a user I want to be able to navigate through the website smoothly.
- When being a user I want to explore more of the Roger Federer site.
- When being a user I want everyone to see the animations. 
- When being a user I want to see how I can sign up.
- When being a user I want to learn more about Federer.

## Site Structure 
- The structure of the Roger Federer Website has three pages overall which include a home page, timeline page and a gallery page. 
- There are social links at the bottom of each page. 
- Every page has the same navigation bar and logo that will bring you back in the home page. 

## Typography
- The font that were used in this website was Poppins.
- Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.
## Colour Choice
- The colours I chose were different types of ed colours including darker and lighter reds and white.
- The reason for this is because Roger Federer is from Swizterland and his flag colours are red and white.

      # Testing 
      ## Home Page
      - In this section I tested the code using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">WC3 Validator HTML</a>
       <img src="./images/html-validator-READme-img.jpg" alt="home page validator">
      ## Timeline Page
      <img src="./images/timeline-validator-img.jpg" alt="timeline validator">
      
      ## Gallery Page
      <img src="./images/gallery-validator-img.jpg" alt="gallery validator">
     
      - Also I tested the code using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">WC3 Validator CSS</a>
         
         <img src="./images/css-validator-READme-img.jpg" alt="CSS Validator">

         - In the HTML part you can see I have a warning about not having a heading in the section footer but it does not effect the code but only a warning.
         ## Responsive
         - as you can see it scales down when viewing in a different size to keep it's shape so it stays uninterrpted.
          <img src="./images/responsive-READme-img.jpg" alt="Timeline size change">

          - As we get into mobile mode inside the gallery it changes it shape by going off one image so the images are still visable to see. 
          <img src="./images/gallery-READme-img (2).jpg" alt="Gallery mobile size">

          - I used Google Developer tool to test the responsiveness of the website.
