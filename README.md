# Features 
<p>Roger Federer website is designed to be user friendly and pleasing to the eye so when you first look at the website you can see where everthing is. It is very miminalistic but effective in a way that doesn't over complicate things. It has features that everyone has used before such as a navigation bar and a form to sign up.  </p>

## Existing Features 

- __Navigation Bar__
    - Navigation Bar is fully responsive where it has three pages and a logo. These items are located at the top of the page and are very easy to access to as you go to different pages on the website as it will keep the same continuity across all pages.
     - The Logo is clickable which will bring you back to the home page if you cannot find your way back to the home page. 
     - There is an animation on the Logo everytime you access a new page or refresh the page to help you locate where it is.

      # Testing 
      - In this section I tested the code using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">WC3 Validator HTML</a>
       <img src="./images/html-validator-READme-img.jpg" alt="Footer">
     
          
      - Also I tested the code using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">WC3 Validator CSS</a>
         
         <img src="./images/css-validator-READme-img.jpg" alt="CSS Validator">

         - In the HTML part you can see I have a warning about not having a heading in the section footer but it does not effect the code but only a warning.
         ## Responsive
         - as you can see it scales down when viewing in a different size to keep it's shape so it stays uninterrpted.
          <img src="./images/responsive-READme-img.jpg" alt="Timeline size change">

          - As we get into mobile mode inside the gallery it changes it shape by going off one image so the images are still visable to see. 
          <img src="./images/gallery-READme-img (2).jpg" alt="Gallery mobile size">

          - I used Google Developer tool to test the responsiveness of the website.


          # Unfixed Bugs
          - The sign up button in the index page is not responsive and could not fix it to scale down when going into different screen sizes.
